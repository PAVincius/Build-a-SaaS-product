# Final Product 
# Build a SaaS product
 Throughout this course, you will learn how to build a static app with authentication that is backed by a database, change the structure of that database without compromising existing data, and take payments for individual products to manage subscriptions.  For your frontend, this application will be using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. You will learn how to maneuver around an app and build a strong static pricing page.  For your backend AND authentication, we will make use of Supabase. Supabase is open source and is all of the backend services that you will need to build your site. It includes a dedicated and scalable Postgres database and user management with Row Level Security!  Lastly, for payments, you will be using Stripe. It will be an individual payment checkout system that will create and update users' subscriptions.

# What you'll learn:

- Query dynamic data in static Next.js pages
- Handle user subscriptions with Stripe
- Store and Access application data in Supabase
- Implement protected content with row level security
  
# Questions to Think About:

- Should this be on client or server?
- Does this require authentication?
- Do I trust this value/do I trust the user should be able to access this?
